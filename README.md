# Note Taker

## Description
An application which allows the user to write and save notes, as well as view previously written notes. When you view the landing page, click the 'get started' button. When the next page loads, simply click on one of the text fields in the right column to write the title and text of your new note. After you're finished, click the 'save' icon above to save your note and display it in the left column. Click on notes in the left column to view them in the right column. This was a tough challenge. But, learning back-end development is a crucial part of being a succesful full-stack developer. Thanks for your consideration.
